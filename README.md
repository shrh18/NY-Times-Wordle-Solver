This is Wordle solver implemented in Python, designed to automate the process of solving the Wordle game by making informed guesses based on letter frequency and placement. It begins by loading valid words from specified files and then iteratively makes guesses, refining the list of potential answers based on feedback provided in the form of guess results, which indicate correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters. The solver uses this feedback to filter out non-matching words and prioritize guesses that are most likely to contain the correct letters in the correct positions. The program continues this process until it correctly guesses the word or exhausts all possibilities, displaying the number of guesses taken to solve the word. The use of the `rich` library enhances the visual output in the terminal.
